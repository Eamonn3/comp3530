                <h1 class="week4">Week 4 - Design thinking</h1>
                <p>Design thinking to me another way to look at problems in the hope of arriving at better and more innovative solution. Traditionally when we see a problem we put our heads down until the problem is solved - design thinking changes this.</p>

                <p>Although I do not see design thinking as a process to be followed I find it helpful to think about it as the 5 steps Standford d school outlines: Empathise, define, ideate, prototype and test. Empathising, ideating (coming up with as many ideas as possible), prototyping and testing are processes that I understand should be followed. However, where I think design thinking offers new ideas is in the define stage. To think about the definition of the problem instead of the problem itself I think frees you to explore different solutions.</p>

                <img src="people.jpg" />
                <p>No problem is the same so as result there is no recipe for innovating a solution. Design thinking is not trying to do this, rather it is a way to look problems differently.</p>
                <p class="para-week2">Despite sounding like they are conflicting methods of thinking I do not think that systems thinking and design thinking are mutually exclusive. I think when using a design thinking approach systems thinking can be used.</p>
                <p class="para-week5">Week 5 introduces the systems engineering lifecycle, similar concepts have been taught throught other computer science courses, although in a more software focused context. Some life cycles seem similar to the design thinking process however, I feel design thinking is not a lifecycle. The iteration though prototyping and testing as well as going back to the user when following a design thinking approach resembles process 3 that Derek Koina talks about. I feel like design thinking is a mentality to solve problems in a different way and a lifecycle is a process to build a solution. I think design thinking can be used, and should be, within a engineering life cycle.</p>
