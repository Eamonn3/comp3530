                <p>This website is a work in progress and will be improved as the learning portfolio progresses. I have only tested it using Chrome and Safari.</p>
                <p class="para-week1">Each week is colour coded. Some information may be displayed next to a coloured bar representing what week the information is related to. As an example this paragraph is colour coded red meaning it "relates" to Week 1 content. Note: I intend to add headings for each section like this so you don't have to remember the colours for each week.</p>
