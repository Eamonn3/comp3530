                <p>The most important idea I took away from this week is that software solves human problems. I think when developing software it is easy to view it from a scientific viewpoint. However, all software must at some point interface with people, and due to the inherent complexity of people, this gives rise to problems. The lecture presented examples where humans cause complexity in both the healthcare and aviation domains. For my COMP3500 group project, we are creating a mobile game. This weekâ€™s topic has influenced me to more carefully consider the human aspects of the project. For example, the user would typically play the game on their mobile phone and probably somewhere away from their home. This information is important to consider because it could have effect on the end product. Just as audio alarms are not relied upon in healthcare, a similar approach may be appropriate for a mobile game as the user may have their phone set to mute.</p>
