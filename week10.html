                <p>The lecture described models as potentially a complete replacement for traditionally developed software. I think it is at least interesting to look at the potential and benefits of this method of software construction.</p>
                <p>In the course Introduction to Software Systems we used UML to gain a better understanding of a small program we worked on as part of a group. Software analysis and design also covered models as supplementary tools in software development. However, I feel previously these models have been mostly concerned with the software system in isolation. I think it would also be helpful to use models to understand systems from a systems engineering perspective also.</p>

                <p>I have been working on a large software system professionally for a number of months. A major challenge I faced, and a similar problem I encountered in the course Software Construction, is trying to learn a large codebase. Reading through code can be an inefficient way to learn and often completely impractical in very large codebases. Looking through code alone can also be misleading or be impossible for learning certain concepts or rationalisations. A model in these situations can allow for a different way to view the software and also better understand the system as a whole.</p>
                <p class="para-week6">Model based systems engineering is related to requirements engineering. A model can be used to describe a software system in the same way that requirements can. However, in my opinion requirements are more focused on the “why” rather than the “how”. I think both requirements and models are useful and complementary to each other.</p>
