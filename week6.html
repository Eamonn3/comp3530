                <p>Requirements are at the foundation of any software project, whether explicitly defined or not. They are important to guide a projects direction but also effective in ensuring that the path taken is a direct one.</p>
                <p>To me there are two main parts to requirements engineering. The first part is the technical side: understanding what functional and non-functional requirements are needed. The second part is dealing with people such as clients, stakeholders, managers, and co-workers. I have previously worked on functional design and costings documents in a professional setting. In retrospect, I can identify the two parts of requirements engineering. The technical side of understanding the details of the design, but also the people side of requirements engineering.</p>

                <p>This topic relates and contrasts with Managing Software Development â€“ COMP3120. Managing Software Development focuses on the mechanics of planning a project whereas in my opinion, requirements engineering looks the analysis and identification of requirements within a system. Whereas courses such as managing Managing Software Development and Software Analysis and Design look at specific details and strategies in gathering requirements, requirements engineering is a higher level analysis.</p>
                <p class="para-week5">Requirements engineering ties into previously covered topics such as systems engineering and thinking. Approaching the design and the planning of a project can be helped with a systems perspective. Looking at the greater context of the project and the interaction of components can help with defining and analysing requirements.</p>
