                <p>A common theme throughout the topics covered, is that of exploring outside forces and factors that impact software. This allows for a broader and more meaningful understanding of the system and systems engineering. Increasingly more important is the topic of the environment and its sustainability. Relevant now is the affect the environment has on software, but also the impact that software has on the environment.</p>

                <p class="para-week4">As mentioned during the lecture, design thinking can be used to achieve sustainability. Design thinking in my opinion is a way to discover innovative solutions and approach problems in a different way. This is important within a sustainability context because the established cost structures often favour the less environmental solution.</p>
                <p class="para-week9">The commercial aspects of engineering is related to sustainability. The lecture on sustainability presented the idea of a balance between the economy, society and the environment. "Do not confuse economic efficiency with social and ecological efficiency‚Äù was a point made during the lecture. Although, a valid point in some circumstances sacrifice may have to be made on ecological efficiency for the sake of economic efficiency.</p>
