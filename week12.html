                <p>Part of what I have learnt during this course is how IT fits into other parts of engineering and society. IT is a tool and the engineering details are usually not the most important part. For example, I have worked on a team that deals with the software people in a call centre use. Many problems that were faced when attempting to improve the software had to do with the fact that much of the design was not convenient for the user and could not be easily changed. For example, if someone wanted to look up information in a particular circumstance it might take a couple minutes of navigation, improvements could be made to the software to better streamline this process. However, when the system was initially designed, these particular circumstances where not considered and now making changes is much more difficult because of this lack of perspective.</p>
                <p>Within the context of the all the topics presented I feel I understand systems engineering better. Because systems engineering is a broad term and covers many different areas, by standing back and looking at all the covered topics can I understand it better. Compared to other engineering domains such as mechanical or electrical engineering that are focused to a tightly defined area of study, systems engineering is much more higher level.</p>
