                <p>Most courses I have studied teach hard technical skills. Some courses teach softer skills such as Managing Software Development (COMP3120). However, there was not been much of a gap between these two areas of study. This link between technical and non-technical courses as well as all courses I undertake during my degree (computer science or otherwise) I hope to understand better because of Systems Engineering.</p>
                <p class="blockquote">Some students, especially those who are self-taught programmers, do not appreciate the need for disciplined approaches to software development. They have a programming model which focuses solely on the software and they do not  understand the relationships between software and other components of large, complex systems</p>
                <p>I hope to gain a better understanding on how to approach problems, and not just analytical programming ones. Systems Engineering seems like a course that doesnâ€™t focus on software - I think this is a good thing. As a programmer it is inevitable that I will have to interact with people of other professions and backgrounds. Looking at software as a component within a larger system will hopefully allow me to gain a better appreciation of the other - equally important - components within that system.</p>
                <h1>1994 Intel Processor Bug</h1>
                <img src="intel.jpg" />
                <p>In 1994 Intel released a new Pentium processor. It leveraged a faster way to calculate floating point numbers by using a look up table. Unfortunately, of the intended 1,066 entries that were needed in the table only 1,061 made it onto the chip. This meant that any calculation that relied on these missing entries would have an error. Although, the chance of an error is incredibly small it caused bugs that seemingly were at the fault of software. </p>
