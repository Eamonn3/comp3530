                <h1 class="week1">Week 1 - Course Introduction and Overview</h1>
                <p>Most courses I have studied teach hard technical skills. Some courses, such as Managing Software Development (COMP3120), teach softer skills. However, there has not been much of a gap between these two areas of study. This link between technical and non-technical courses as well as a connection between all courses I undertake during my degree (computer science or otherwise) I hope to understand better because of Systems Engineering.</p>
                <p class="blockquote">Some students, especially those who are self-taught programmers, do not appreciate the need for disciplined approaches to software development. They have a programming model which focuses solely on the software and they do not  understand the relationships between software and other components of large, complex systems.</p>
                <p>I aim to use this course as an opportunity to grow from a software developer to software engineer.<p>
                <p>I hope to gain a better understanding on how to approach problems, and not just analytical programming ones. Systems Engineering seems like a course that doesnâ€™t focus on software - I think this is a good thing. As a programmer it is inevitable that I will have to interact with people of other professions and backgrounds. Looking at software as a component within a larger system will hopefully allow me to gain a better appreciation of the other - equally important - components within that system.</p>
                <h1>1994 Intel Processor Bug</h1>
                <img src="intel.jpg" />
                <p>In 1994 Intel released a new Pentium processor. It leveraged a faster way to calculate floating point numbers by using a look up table. Unfortunately, of the intended 1,066 entries that were needed in the table only 1,061 made it onto the chip. This meant that any calculation that relied on these missing entries would have an error. Although, the chance of an error is incredibly small it caused bugs that seemingly were at the fault of software. </p>
                <p class="para-week5">This loosely ties into the ideas presented in week 5; that software exists as part of a system. Software has to interact with hardware and interact with society as a whole. An example that Derek Koina gave during the week 5 lecture that I think illustrates this point is that of filtering out high frequency noise on an embedded system. This problem was difficult to solve using software but much more easily solved with hardware. Using systems thinking and systems engineering saw a successful solution in this situation.</p>
