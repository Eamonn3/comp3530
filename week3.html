                <p>Previously I thought of an engineer as simply someone who uses maths and science to solve problems. However, this is only a small part of the job. Engineering is a job about people.</p>
                <p>Engineering cannot be treated as a purely analytical field. What I learnt this week was way different way to view engineering. To look at it <i>“within a systems context”</i> and <i>“as a human activity”</i>.</p>

                <p>To be an engineer is to work towards the development of society. Usually unnoticed, the impacts that engineering has had on our lives is immense. From simple things such as watching television or playing a video game, engineers have designed. To more serious applications of engineering such as cars, planes and military weaponry, our lives are daily put at the mercy of engineering. Engineers hold a lot of responsibility.</p>

                <p>I have worked on a project where user information was being stored and consequently ensuring the security of the system was very important. However, not every single corner case can be tested and some issues will never be discovered. This causes a delicate balance between security and budget and both cannot be achieved perfectly.</p>
